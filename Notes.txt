Key points:
- Only a good programmer can become a good modeler in design phase.
- Model on giant whiteboards.
- Model a lot at the start of the sprint/analysis phase.
- Only truth is code. UML diagrams assist in writing/understanding code.
- Notation is not very important; Notation is good if it conveys the message.
- Sub teams can see each other's UML diagrams.
- Diagram with programmers and analysts together for shared understanding.
- Multiple models go together, e.g., Software class diagram and interaction diagram.
- Document important aspects of the project at the end of the project.
- UML tool is very useful for reverse engineering i.e. generating diagrams from code.
- In design, communication diagrams are important.

Large project will have multiple Bounded contexts.
Each bounded context will be encapsulated with boundry classes.
Boundry classes static functions and interfaces.

Bounded contexts are logical entities.
Components are physical entities.

Library should be encapsulated with boundry classes.
